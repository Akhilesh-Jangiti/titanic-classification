# Titanic Survival Prediction â€“ ML Models

This project compares multiple classification models to predict survival on the Titanic using:
- Logistic Regression
- KNN
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- SVM
- XGBoost

Built in Google Colab using pandas, scikit-learn, and xgboost.

## Dataset
Source: [Datasciencedojo Titanic CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv)

## To Run:
- Open notebook in Colab
- Run cells top-to-bottom
- Results are printed for each model

## Output
Classification reports and accuracy comparisons for each ML model.
